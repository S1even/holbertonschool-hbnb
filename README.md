# Holberton School - HBNB

This project is a simplified clone of the popular AirBnB platform, made as part of the Holberton School program. It is a progressive project divided into several parts, covering key concepts like database management, backend development, API creation, and front-end development.

## Description

The AirBnB clone project aims to reproduce some of AirBnB's main features, while learning the fundamentals of software development:

Managing a backend with Python and SQLAlchemy.
Developing a RESTful API.
Creating a static and then dynamic user interface.
Deepening good programming practices, such as modularity, unit testing and continuous integration.

## Features

### Console CLI (Command-Line Interface) :

- Allows you to manage application objects (users, locations, reviews, etc.).

- Commands to create, read, update, and delete instances.

- Supports local backup (JSON) and SQL databases.

### Backend :

- Data management via a relational database (MySQL).

- SQLAlchemy ORM to manipulate models.

### RESTful API:

- Provides access points to interact with data.

- Returns results in JSON format.

### Technologies Used

- ``Python``: for backend and CLI scripts.

- ``Flask``: web framework for dynamic development.

- ``SQLAlchemy``: ORM to manage MySQL database.

- ``MySQL``: relational database.

- ``JavaScript & AJAX``: to add interactivity.

- ``HTML/CSS``: for user interface.
